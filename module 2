## What I Learned

This video gave me a comprehensive introduction to the **relationships**, **types**, and **applications** of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

## Key Concepts

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- A technique that enables machines to mimic human behavior.
- Goal: Make systems "smart" and able to reason, learn, and self-correct.

### Machine Learning (ML)
- A subset of AI that uses statistical methods to enable systems to improve from experience.
- Relies heavily on data and algorithms.

### Deep Learning (DL)
- A subset of ML that leverages multi-layered neural networks.
- Makes handling high-dimensional data like images, audio, and text feasible.


## Machine Learning Types

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Learns from labeled data.
   - Tasks: Regression and Classification
   - Algorithms:
     - Linear Regression
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest
     - Naive Bayes Classifier
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Works on unlabeled data
   - Tasks: Clustering and **Association
   - Used in: Market basket analysis, Customer segmentation

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Reward-based learning
   - Agent learns through interaction with environment and rewards/punishments
   - Common in robotics and game AI


## Limitations of Machine Learning

- Struggles with high-dimensional data
- Manual feature extraction is complex
- Performance drops when data is noisy or insufficient


## Neural Networks & Deep Learning

- Deep Learning automates **feature extraction**
- Artificial Neurons (Perceptrons):
  - Inputs with weights
  - Weighted sum + activation function → Output
- Backpropagation is the core training algorithm
- Maximum weight is assigned to the most important inputs

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Used in image recognition
- Neurons in a layer are only connected to a local region of the previous layer

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Designed for sequence data: text, speech, time series
- Memory of previous inputs helps understand context


## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Subfield of AI that handles human language
- Applications:
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Chatbots
  - Speech Recognition
  - Machine Translation

### Key NLP Concepts
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into smaller chunks
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form
- **Lemmatization**: Similar to stemming but context aware
- **Stop Words**: Common words removed to focus on important terms
- **Document Term Matrix (DTM)**: Matrix representation of text corpus


## Data & Preprocessing

- Data is the solution. In ML, quality & quantity matter
- **Splicing**: Dividing data into training and testing sets
- Discrete vs Continuous variables in data
- Python examples were used for sentiment analysis


## Reflection

This video gave me a big-picture view of the AI field. Understanding the relationships between AI, ML, and DL, plus diving into neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and NLP.
